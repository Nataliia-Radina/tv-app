# tv-app

```
This is app build based on http://www.tvmaze.com/api 
I have used Vue.js framework to build it alongside with Vue.cli, VueRouter and Vuex.
I have selected Vue to show my knowledge of this framework. But I think React or some other frameworks 
could be nice choice for this problem as well.
I also used Vuetify to speed up the dev process, and jest to write tests. 
I covered store with unit tests because I think it is very important.
